# Ted Reed Syncopation Bot

Thanks for looking at my repo :)

This project is dedicated to all my drum teachers (esp. Ed Taylor, who taught me just how much can be learned from a page of eighth notes).

Many drummers are intimately familiar with Ted Reed's _Progressive Steps to Syncopation for the Modern Drummer_. I'm sure many (like me), have played the eighth note exercises so much that they have memorized them.

The Ted Reed Syncopation Bot allows drummers (or anyone else) to randomly generate up to 500 measures of syncopation exercises to re-introduce the challenge of sight reading into their practice.
